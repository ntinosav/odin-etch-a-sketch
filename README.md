Etch-A-Sketch Project from Odin

Some minor differences :
 - Squares don't change color when hovering. Instead, a border appears.
   It was changed so that the user can see the new color immediately.
 - If the user clicks a square when it has become opaque, its opacity
   resets to 0.1
 - Squares have 100ms transition. (Thought it looked a tiny bit more pleasing)
